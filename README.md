- Modern web browser with JavaScript enabled

## 🔧 Installation & Setup

### Option 1: Create React App

```bash
# Create new React application
npx create-react-app bookfinder-app
cd bookfinder-app

# Install additional dependencies
npm install lucide-react

# Replace src/App.js with the provided code
# Replace src/App.css with Tailwind imports (see below)

# Start development server
npm start
```

### Option 2: Quick Deploy to CodeSandbox

1. Go to [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io)
2. Create new React project
3. Copy the provided React code into `App.js`
4. Add Tailwind CSS to dependencies
5. Run the project

```

## 🔑 Required Dependencies

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "lucide-react": "^0.263.1"
  }
}
```

## 🎨 CSS Setup (Tailwind)

Add to `src/index.css`:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```

## 🌐 API Integration

### Open Library Search API

The application uses the Open Library Search API with the following endpoints:

```javascript
// Search by title
https://openlibrary.org/search.json?title={query}

// Search by author
https://openlibrary.org/search.json?author={query}

// Search by subject
https://openlibrary.org/search.json?subject={query}

// Search by ISBN
https://openlibrary.org/search.json?isbn={query}

// General search
https://openlibrary.org/search.json?q={query}
```

### Cover Images
Book covers are fetched from Open Library's cover API:
```
https://covers.openlibrary.org/b/id/{cover_id}-M.jpg
```

## 💾 Data Persistence

### localStorage Implementation

The application uses browser localStorage to persist:
- **Favorites**: `bookfinder-favorites` key
- **Reading List**: `bookfinder-reading-list` key

### Storage Structure

```javascript
// Example localStorage data
localStorage.getItem('bookfinder-favorites')
// Returns: '[{"key":"/works/123","title":"Book Title",...}]'
```

## 🧪 Development Notes

### Component Architecture

The application is built as a single React component with clear sections:

1. **State Management**: All state using React hooks
2. **API Integration**: Async functions for book searching
3. **UI Components**: Reusable components for book cards and modals
4. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Tailwind classes

### Key Functions

```javascript
// Main search function
const searchBooks = async () => { /* API call logic */ }

// Favorites management
const toggleFavorite = (book) => { /* Add/remove from favorites */ }

// Reading list management
const toggleReadingList = (book) => { /* Add/remove from reading list */ }
```

## 🎯 Use Cases for College Students

### 📖 Academic Research
- Search by subject to find relevant academic books
- Filter by publication year for current research
- Save important references to favorites

### 📚 Course Preparation
- Build reading lists for upcoming semesters
- Search by ISBN for specific textbook editions
- Track books with e-book availability for digital access

### 🔍 Discovery & Exploration
- Explore new authors in your field of study
- Discover related subjects and interdisciplinary works
- Maintain a personal reading list for leisure reading

## 🔧 Customization Options

### Styling Modifications
- Change color scheme by modifying Tailwind classes
- Adjust layout breakpoints for different screen sizes
- Customize book card layouts

### Feature Extensions
- Add user reviews and ratings
- Implement book recommendations
- Add export functionality for reading lists
- Integration with library systems

### API Enhancements
- Add more search filters
- Implement advanced search combinations
- Add book availability checking

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**localStorage not working**:
- Ensure you're not running in Claude.ai artifacts
- Deploy to a real web hosting platform
- Check browser privacy settings

**API requests failing**:
- Verify internet connection
- Check CORS policies (shouldn't be an issue with Open Library API)
- Ensure API URL formatting is correct

**Styling not loading**:
- Verify Tailwind CSS is properly imported
- Check for CSS import errors in console
- Ensure all required dependencies are installed

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

- **Result Limiting**: Limited to 20 search results for optimal loading
- **Image Lazy Loading**: Cover images load on demand
- **Debounced Search**: Prevents excessive API calls
- **Error Boundaries**: Graceful error handling throughout
